# Application 

Application between player and GameBox. Player input data to GameBox by using Application and GameBox output Graphics and Audio by using Application.

It is a concrete application framework. **User need not to program Application script**(Maybe we will support C# script for this). 

## Event

In most time, Application only transmit events from Player to GameBox.
