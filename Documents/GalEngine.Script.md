# GalEngine.Script 

For making game, we need make some objects by ourselves.
So we need a way to do this. There are why we use the script to make game.

In GalEngine, Script is not like traditional script. It likes a logic diagram.
The mainbody of script is state. It contains the logic code, the next state and so on.

**The code style are similar to Python, In fact we use `tab` for distinguishing code sentences.**

## 

## State

We use `{}` to define a state. Like this:

```gs
{
    ...
}
```
